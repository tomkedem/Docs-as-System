# Docs-as-System™

**Docs-as-System™** is a software development methodology conceived and defined by **Tomer Kedem (2025)**.  
It treats documentation, code, and governance as a single living system —  
a continuous interface between **humans, agents, and machines**.

---

## 🧭 Definition

In the age of agentic and AI-driven development, Docs-as-System™ redefines how we build and maintain software.  
It sees documentation not as an afterthought, but as an operational layer —  
the connective tissue between *intent*, *execution*, and *traceability*.

> When a human defines — the agent acts.  
> When the agent acts — the documentation updates.

Together, they form a self-evolving system that remains understandable and auditable at every stage.

## 📜 Manifesto (Core Principles)

1️⃣ **Understanding Before Action** – Development begins with definition, not command.  
2️⃣ **Documentation as a System** – Docs are active components, not appendices.  
3️⃣ **Mutual Update Loop** – Docs and code evolve together.  
4️⃣ **Human Traceability** – Every change can be explained.  
5️⃣ **Human Responsibility** – The agent proposes; the human approves.  
6️⃣ **Living Transparency** – Docs reflect system state in real time.  
7️⃣ **Human–Agent Synchronization** – Shared language between people and AI.  
8️⃣ **Evolution Through Documentation** – Clarity replaces chaos.  
9️⃣ **Control Through Documentation** – Governance, not paperwork.  
🔟 **A Documented System Is a Sustainable System.**
