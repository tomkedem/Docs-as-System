## 🧭 Overview

**Docs-as-System™** is a development methodology that redefines documentation  
as an integral, living part of every software system.  
It introduces a structured approach where documentation, code, and governance  
work together as one synchronized entity — human-readable, agent-accessible, and always up to date.

The concept was created by **Tomer Kedem (2025)**  
as part of *“The Documented Project”*,  
a practical framework for developing, documenting, and maintaining  
AI-assisted systems in the age of intelligent agents.

## 🧩 Philosophy

Docs-as-System™ establishes a simple truth:

> **Understanding comes before execution.**  
> Every decision, every agent, every commit —  
> must trace back to a documented intent.

It defines a new bridge between **humans and agents**,  
where documentation is not an afterthought —  
it is the system’s living interface of meaning, change, and control.
