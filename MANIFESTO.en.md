## The Docs-as-System Manifesto

> Docs-as-System is a live development methodology in which documentation, code,  
> and an agent integrated into the IDE operate together as one synchronized system.

A truly intelligent system is not the one that works alone,  
but the one that remains understandable long after everyone has gone home.

### 🧭 Core Principles of Docs-as-System

**1️⃣ Understanding Before Action**  
Development does not begin with a command but with definition.  
The document is the starting point, not a late-stage appendix.

**2️⃣ Documentation as Part of the System**  
Documents are not auxiliary files. They are active components that drive agents and business logic.

**3️⃣ Mutual Updating**  
When documents change, the system changes.  
When the system changes, the documents update.  
This keeps intent and execution aligned at all times.

**4️⃣ Human Traceability**  
Every decision, change, and commit can be explained.  
Not just *how* things work, but *why* they are right.

**5️⃣ Human Responsibility**  
The agent proposes; the human approves.  
The human commit is a point of oversight, not a bottleneck.

**6️⃣ Living Transparency**  
Documentation is not a static file but a live interface—  
a real-time window into status, architecture, and intent.

**7️⃣ Human–Agent Synchronization**  
Docs-as-System is the new coordination language between humans and agents.  
It defines the contract between understanding and execution,  
living directly in the development environment where the agent interprets documents,  
performs actions, and maintains real-time synchronization between both worlds.

**8️⃣ Evolution Through Documentation**  
When documentation is done well, the system evolves safely.  
When documentation is neglected, the system loses control.

**9️⃣ Governance Through Documentation**  
Proper documentation is a management tool, not just a technical artifact.

**🔟 A Documented System Is a Sustainable System**  
Docs-as-System ensures that a system never gets lost inside its own code.

### 🛠 Practical Expression of the Manifesto

To ensure that these principles become practice rather than theory, Docs-as-System includes:

• Structured methodology templates in dedicated folders  
• An npm starter package that creates a live documented project  
• A VS Code extension that brings the methodology directly into the developer’s workspace

This combination enables developers, architects, and managers to work with an IDE-integrated agent  
without losing control, responsibility, or continuous documentation.

### 🧩 About the Term

The Docs-as-System methodology was developed by Tomer Kedem in 2025  
as a practical work framework for developing, managing, and maintaining systems  
based on an IDE-integrated agent and AI-assisted development.

## ✍️ Author’s Note

This document was written by Tomer Kedem with the assistance of an AI editing agent  
integrated directly into the IDE, in accordance with the principles of Docs-as-System—  
where human and agent work together through living, evolving documentation.
