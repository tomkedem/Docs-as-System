# Docs-as-System™ Manifesto (English)

> A truly intelligent system is not the one that works alone -  
> but the one that remains understandable long after everyone has gone home.

## 🧭 Core Principles of Docs-as-System™

### 1️⃣ Understanding Before Action  
Development does not start with a command - it starts with a definition.  
The document is the beginning, not the byproduct.

### 2️⃣ Documentation as Part of the System  
Documents are not side files, but active components that drive agents and logic.

### 3️⃣ Mutual Update Loop  
When documentation changes - the system changes.  
When the system changes - the documentation updates.  
Consistency is preserved between thinking and execution.

### 4️⃣ Human Traceability  
Every decision, change, and commit can be explained.  
Not only how it works - but why it is right.

### 5️⃣ Human Responsibility  
The agent proposes, the human approves.  
The human commit is a moment of control - not a bottleneck.

### 6️⃣ Living Transparency  
Documentation is not a frozen file, but a living interface -  
a real-time window into status, architecture, and intent.

### 7️⃣ Human-Agent Synchronization  
Docs-as-System™ is the new coordination language between humans and agents.  
It defines the contract between understanding and execution.

### 8️⃣ Evolution Through Documentation  
When documentation is precise - the system evolves confidently.  
When it is neglected - the system loses control.

### 9️⃣ Governance Through Documentation  
Proper documentation is a managerial tool - not just a technical artifact.

### 🔟 A Documented System Is a Sustainable System  
Docs-as-System™ ensures that no system will ever be lost inside its own code.
