## The Docs-as-System™ Manifesto

> _Docs-as-System™ is a living development methodology where documentation, code, and an IDE-integrated agent work together as one synchronized system._

A truly intelligent system isn’t the one that runs on its own —  
it’s the one that remains understandable long after everyone has gone home.

### 🧭 Core Principles

**1️⃣ Understanding Before Action**  
Development doesn’t begin with a command — it begins with a definition.  
The document is the starting point, not an afterthought.

**2️⃣ Documentation as Part of the System**  
Documents are not side files. They are active components that drive agents and business logic.

**3️⃣ Mutual Update**  
When the documentation changes — the system changes.  
When the system evolves — the documentation follows.  
This keeps thought and execution perfectly aligned.

**4️⃣ Human Traceability**  
Every decision, change, and commit can be explained.  
Not just *how* it works — but *why* it’s right.

**5️⃣ Human Responsibility**  
The agent proposes, the human approves.  
The human commit is a moment of control — not a bottleneck.

**6️⃣ Living Transparency**  
Documentation is not a frozen file — it’s a living interface:  
a real-time window into the system’s status, architecture, and intent.

**7️⃣ Synchronization Between Human and Agent**  
The Docs-as-System™ methodology serves as the new shared language between humans and agents.  
It defines the contract between understanding and execution,  
and it lives directly inside the developer’s IDE —  
where the agent interprets documentation, performs actions, and keeps both sides in sync.

**8️⃣ Evolution Through Documentation**  
When documentation is precise — systems evolve with confidence.  
When it’s neglected — systems lose their direction.

**9️⃣ Governance Through Documentation**  
Good documentation is a management tool — not just a technical artifact.

**🔟 A Documented System Is a Sustainable System**  
Through its methodology, Docs-as-System™ ensures that a system is never lost within its own code.

### 🧩 About the Term

The Docs-as-System™ methodology was developed by **Tomer Kedem** in **2025**,  
as a practical framework for building, managing, and maintaining  
AI-driven systems powered by an IDE-integrated agent.

## ✍️ Author’s Note

This document was written by **Tomer Kedem**,  
with the assistance of an AI-powered agent integrated directly into the IDE,  
in full alignment with the principles of **Docs-as-System™** —  
where humans and agents collaborate through living, evolving documentation.
