# Docs-as-System™ Manifesto (English)

> A truly intelligent system is not the one that works alone —  
> but the one that stays understandable long after everyone has gone home.

## 🧭 Core Principles of Docs-as-System™

### 1️⃣ Understanding Before Action  
Development doesn’t start with a command – it starts with a definition.  
The document is the beginning, not the byproduct.

### 2️⃣ Documentation as Part of the System  
Docs are not appendices. They are active components that drive agents and logic.

### 3️⃣ Mutual Update Loop  
When docs change — the system evolves.  
When the system evolves — the docs update.  
Clarity replaces drift.

### 4️⃣ Human Traceability  
Every decision, change, and commit can be explained —  
not only how it works, but *why it’s right*.

### 5️⃣ Human Responsibility  
The agent proposes. The human approves.  
The human commit is not a bottleneck — it’s a moment of control.

### 6️⃣ Living Transparency  
Documentation is a live interface — a real-time reflection of intent, design, and state.

### 7️⃣ Human–Agent Synchronization  
Docs-as-System™ defines the shared language between people and agents.  
It’s the contract between understanding and execution.

### 8️⃣ Evolution Through Documentation, Not Chaos  
Well-documented systems evolve confidently.  
Undocumented ones collapse silently.

### 9️⃣ Control Through Documentation, Not Intuition  
Proper documentation is not paperwork — it’s governance.

### 🔟 A Documented System Is a Sustainable System  
Docs-as-System™ ensures no system is ever lost inside its own code.
