# About Docs-as-System™

Docs-as-System™ was born from a simple yet revolutionary insight:  
**Documentation is not a byproduct of code – it is part of the system itself.**

Created by **Tomer Kedem**, a senior software engineer and tech lead,  
the concept emerged from observing how complex projects  
often fail not because of bad code – but because of missing understanding.  

In an era where AI agents collaborate within the development process,  
we need a new methodology – one where documentation, code, and governance  
work together as a living system.  

Docs-as-System™ defines that bridge:  
a shared language between humans, agents, and machines.  
A framework where every change is documented in real time,  
and every decision can be explained long after it was made.  

The term was coined and developed in **2025**  
as part of *“The Documented Project”* –  
a practical framework for building and maintaining  
AI-assisted, human-readable systems.  

Docs-as-System™ is not just a technical approach.  
It is a philosophy of clarity, traceability, and shared understanding.  
It begins with documentation – and it never ends with code.
