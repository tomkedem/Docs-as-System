## About Docs-as-System

**Docs-as-System** is a living development methodology born out of a real need:  
to operate and manage an AI agent integrated into the IDE in a precise, documented, and controlled way.  

As intelligent development agents began entering modern IDEs, developers around the world discovered a new challenge —  
the agent understands code, but not always the context, intent, or boundaries of responsibility.  
It can write excellent code, but not necessarily the *right* code.  

**Docs-as-System** was created to solve exactly this problem.  
It defines a framework in which documentation becomes part of the system itself — a living language through which humans and agents understand one another.  
Documents are not byproducts but *operational drivers* from which the agent derives intent and to which it writes back in real time as the system evolves.  

This creates a documented and closed loop of:  
**Understanding → Action → Documentation → Control.**  

In this model, the agent does not work alone — it operates as part of a documented, human-centered system  
that can explain every change, not just execute it.  
**Docs-as-System** establishes a shared language between humans, agents, and systems — ensuring that every action is explainable, every decision has a source, and every piece of code preserves the context from which it originated.  

The methodology was developed in 2025 by **Tomer Kedem**, as a practical framework for developing, managing, and maintaining systems  
powered by an IDE-integrated agent and AI-driven development processes.  

**Docs-as-System** is not just a technical method — it is a new way of thinking:  
development that begins with understanding, is grounded in documentation, and results in systems that remain understandable long after everyone has gone home.
