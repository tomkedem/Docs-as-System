# About Docs-as-System™

The idea behind **Docs-as-System™** was born from a simple insight:  
Documentation is not a byproduct of code — it’s part of the system itself.

**Tomer Kedem**, a certified Software Architect and Development Team Lead,  
recognized that in complex projects, the gap between what’s documented and what’s actually implemented  
is one of the main sources of chaos, errors, and lost accountability.

In an era where AI agents are becoming an active part of the development process,  
a new methodology is needed — one where documentation, code, and control  
operate together as a living entity.

This is the foundation of **Docs-as-System™**:  
a shared language connecting humans, agents, and systems.  
A framework where every change is recorded in real time,  
and every decision remains explainable — even years later.

The concept was developed in **2025** by Tomer Kedem  
as a practical framework for building, managing, and maintaining systems  
in an age where artificial intelligence is not just a tool — but a partner.

**Docs-as-System™** is more than a technical method — it’s a mindset:  
development that starts with understanding,  
relies on documentation,  
and results in systems that stay clear and traceable long after everyone’s gone home.
