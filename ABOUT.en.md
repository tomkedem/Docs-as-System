## About ™Docs-as-System

™Docs-as-System was born out of a real need —  
to close the gap between what was documented and what was actually implemented.  

The core idea is simple: documentation is not an attachment to the code,  
it is part of the system itself.  
When an AI agent integrated into the IDE operates based on living documents,  
it can understand intent, execute actions, and record them in real time.  

The methodology was developed in 2025 by **Tomer Kedem**,  
as a practical framework for building systems  
where humans and agents collaborate through living, evolving documentation.  

™Docs-as-System is not just a technical method — it is a new mindset:  
development that begins with understanding,  
is grounded in documentation,  
and ends with a system that remains understandable long after everyone has gone home.
