# About Docs-as-System™

> _Docs-as-System™ is a living development methodology where documentation, code, and an IDE-integrated agent work together as one synchronized system._

The idea behind **Docs-as-System™** was born from a simple insight:  
Documentation is not a byproduct of code — it’s part of the system itself.

**Tomer Kedem**, a certified Software Architect and Development Team Lead,  
recognized that in complex projects, the gap between what’s documented and what’s actually implemented  
is one of the main sources of chaos, errors, and lost accountability.

In an era where AI agents have become an active part of software development,  
a new methodology is required — one where documentation, code, and control  
work together as a single, living system.

At the core of this methodology stands the **IDE-embedded Agent**:  
an intelligent assistant that operates directly within the development environment.  
It reads documents, interprets intent, executes actions, and continuously synchronizes  
between written understanding and the actual implementation in real time.

This is the foundation of **Docs-as-System™** —  
a shared language connecting humans, agents, and systems.  
Every change is recorded instantly, and every decision remains explainable, even years later.

The concept was developed in **2025** by Tomer Kedem  
as a practical framework for building, managing, and maintaining systems  
in an age where artificial intelligence is not just a tool — but a partner.

**Docs-as-System™** is more than a technical method — it’s a mindset:  
development that begins with understanding,  
relies on documentation,  
and results in systems that remain clear and traceable long after everyone’s gone home.
