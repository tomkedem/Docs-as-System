## About **Docs-as-System**

**Docs-as-System** is a live development methodology created from a real need to operate and manage an **AI agent integrated into the IDE** in a precise, documented, and controlled way.

As intelligent agents entered development environments, developers worldwide discovered a clear problem: the agent understands the code, but not always the **context**, the **intent**, or its **boundaries of responsibility**.  
It can write excellent code, but not necessarily the *right* code.

Docs-as-System was created to address exactly this.  
It defines an infrastructure where **documentation is part of the system**, a living language through which the human and the agent understand each other.  
The documents are not a byproduct but an **execution engine** from which the agent derives intent and updates the system documentation back in real time.

This establishes a documented, closed loop of:

**Understanding → Action → Documentation → Control**

In this model, the agent does not work alone. It operates within a human-driven and documented framework that can **explain every change**, not just execute it.  
Docs-as-System creates one shared language between human, agent, and system, ensuring that every action is explainable, every decision has a source, and every piece of code preserves the context it originated from.

### From theory to working tools

In 2025, Docs-as-System moved from a theoretical methodology to the foundation of **practical tools** that make it usable in real-world projects:

• An npm starter package named **`docs-as-system-starterkit`**  
• An official VS Code extension named **Docs-as-System**  
• A structured set of **methodology templates** that can be integrated into any project

These tools allow you to:

• Set up a new project ready to work with an agent within minutes  
• Separate **intent**, **execution**, and **control** without losing the connection between them  
• Provide the agent with a **clear operational framework**, while the developer maintains full control

Docs-as-System is not just a way to write documents it is a way to build a system that documents itself as it evolves.

The methodology was developed in 2025 by **Tomer Kedem** as a practical framework for developing, managing, and maintaining systems based on an **IDE-integrated agent** and AI that supports software development.

Docs-as-System is not just a technique but a **new way of thinking** about development: one that starts with understanding, is grounded in documentation, and ends with a system that remains understandable long after everyone has gone home.
