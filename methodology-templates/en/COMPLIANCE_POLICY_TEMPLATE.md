# Compliance & Development Policy Template

**File:** `COMPLIANCE_POLICY.md`  
**Created by:** AI Agent (under precise human guidance)  
**Approved by:** Human (CISO / Chief Architect / Lead QA)  
**Specification Type:** Policy Document  

---

## Introductory Note – Universal Usage

This document is part of the **Docs-as-System™** universal template suite,  
serving as a foundation for documentation, control, and governance  
across all software domains – Web, Mobile, Backend, Cloud, Data, AI, Embedded, or Multi-Agent.  

The template assumes a workflow where the **agent (AI)** executes operations  
while the **human** retains authority, approval, and responsibility.  
The agent acts under a documented policy, records every action,  
and performs **local commits only** in a version control system (Git or similar).  
The human reviews and performs the **final merge**.  

**Core Principle:**  
Agent implements → Human approves → Git preserves truth.  

---

## Purpose

To define the rules, responsibilities, and standards  
for developing systems collaboratively with AI agents.  
This policy ensures consistent, secure, and accountable workflows  
where the agent assists in documentation, coding, and validation  
while the human maintains full control, review, and ownership.

## Human–Agent Responsibility Matrix

| Area | Agent Responsibility | Human Responsibility |
|------|-----------------------|----------------------|
| **Planning** | Suggests structures and diagrams | Reviews and validates decisions |
| **Coding** | Generates helper code, tests, and documentation | Implements business logic and performs code review |
| **Documentation** | Creates summaries and real-time reports | Verifies and approves accuracy |
| **Testing** | Performs self-validation | Approves critical test results |
| **Deployment** | Proposes configurations and monitoring checks | Approves final execution |

**Fundamental Rule:**  
The human defines intent → the agent executes → the human approves.  

---

## Information Security & Privacy

- The agent does **not** store passwords, API keys, or sensitive data.  
- Sensitive data in logs or documentation must be masked or encrypted.  
- No external data transmission occurs without human authorization.  
- All agent activities are logged as part of human audit processes.  
- Every access to information is timestamped and linked to a human–agent trace ID.  

---

## Code Quality & Review Policy

- Every change generated by the agent must undergo **human code review** before merge.  
- No direct commits are allowed to protected branches.  
- The agent must maintain consistent structure, naming, and coding standards.  
- Self-check validation is mandatory before every change.  
- Review feedback is used by the agent to improve future iterations.  

---

## Change & Version Management

- Every change must be documented in `CHANGELOG.md` with task ID and timestamp.  
- Major updates require explicit **human approval**.  
- Rollback procedures must exist for all critical changes.  
- Versioning follows the **Semantic Versioning (SemVer)** standard.  
- The agent assists in identifying undocumented or untracked changes.  

## SLA / SLO and Operational Quality

- All agent-generated outputs are **reviewed by humans** before usage.  
- Any deviation from quality metrics halts the process until human validation.  
- Periodic reports include:  
  - Accuracy rate compared to specifications.  
  - Percentage of human-approved operations.  
  - Percentage of agent outputs requiring correction.  

| Metric | Target | Review Frequency |
|---------|---------|------------------|
| Code accuracy vs. specification | ≥ 95% | Weekly |
| Documentation transparency | 100% | Continuous |
| Human-approved actions | ≥ 90% | Weekly |

---

## Testing & Quality Assurance

- All code produced by the agent must be tested by humans through unit, integration, and acceptance tests.  
- The agent generates **self-validation reports** after every operational cycle.  
- All results must be reviewed before merge or deployment approval.  
- Regression testing is mandatory after any major logic change.  

---

## Monitoring, Logging & Audit Trail

- Every agent action is automatically logged in `IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md`.  
- Each event must have a unified **trace ID** linking human–agent–system interactions.  
- Logs are written in **structured JSON** format.  
- Any anomaly or deviation is reviewed by a human and documented in `BUG_REPORT.md`.  

---

## Disaster Recovery, Backup & Restoration

- The agent maintains **logical snapshots** of critical configurations.  
- Each major change must include an accompanying **recovery script**.  
- Backups are performed automatically daily or with each significant commit.  
- Restorations or corrective actions require explicit **human approval** before execution.  

---

## Agent Behavior Tracking

While direct control over the AI model version is not possible,  
monitoring behavioral changes due to updates or prompt variations is mandatory.

- Any noticeable shift in tone, code style, or file structure is logged.  
- The agent records such deviations and requests approval for continued use.  
- If significant drift occurs, a **human consistency review** is required.  

## Ethics & Transparency

- Every agent action must be **explainable**.  
- Each recommendation or modification must include a clear rationale.  
- No autonomous operations may occur without proper documentation.  
- **Final responsibility always remains human.**

---

## Documentation & Continuity Policy

- Every development phase must include **automatic documentation** with **human approval**.  
- The agent ensures consistency across all project documents.  
- Any change to one document requires synchronized updates across related artifacts.  
- All documentation is stored in a **unified repository** with full version history.  

---

## Agent Collaboration Note

The agent operates as a **technical team member**, assisting by:  

- Ensuring each stage aligns with prior specifications.  
- Suggesting improvements in both documentation and code.  
- Maintaining coherence and ongoing traceability throughout the project.  

**Human reviewers** retain final decision-making authority, approvals, and sign-offs.  

---

## Summary

This document ensures that human–agent collaboration adheres to  
consistent, transparent, and accountable standards.  
It defines the **rules of engagement** for development in an era  
where automation and human oversight coexist —  
protecting quality, consistency, and professional ethics over time.  

---

## General Operating Principles

- All project documentation files (Business → Validation) reside in the same repository as the code.  
- The agent performs **local commits only**, under a dedicated branch (e.g., `agent-workspace`).  
- Merges or modifications to protected branches (`main`, `release`) require explicit **human approval**.  
- Every commit must reference an associated task in `PLAN.md` and a record in `IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md`.  
- Each action includes a timestamp, agent identifier, and human approver ID.  

**Standardized Tags:**
- `AI_GENERATED` – Created by agent  
- `HUMAN_APPROVED` – Approved by human  
- `VALIDATED` – Passed self-checks and human verification  

**Objective:**  
To ensure full **traceability** — knowing at any moment *what* changed, *why*, and *who approved it*.  

> Git functions here not only as a code repository but as the **signature system** of the entire development process.
