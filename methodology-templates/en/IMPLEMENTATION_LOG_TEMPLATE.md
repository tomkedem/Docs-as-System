# IMPLEMENTATION_LOG_TEMPLATE.en.md

**Document Type:** Implementation and Activity Log  
**Purpose:** Enables automatic, consistent, and transparent documentation of all development activities collected directly from PRs, CI pipelines, commits, and the agent logs.  
**Related Files:** `AGENT_OPERATIONAL_POLICY.md`, `HUMAN_OPERATIONAL_POLICY.md`, `SECURITY_CHECKLIST.md`, `VALIDATION_REPORT.md`

---

## 1. Operating Principle

`IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md` is automatically created and updated by the agent in real time,  
based on data gathered from the version control system (Git), CI processes, and code reviews (PRs).  

The human developer is not required to fill in anything manually — only to approve, correct, or clarify when necessary.

---

## 2. Automatic Record Structure

Each action or change is automatically logged in a unified format:

| Field | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **Date** | Automatically taken from the commit or PR timestamp |
| **Action ID** | Generated by the agent (e.g., `IMP-2025-0012`) |
| **Action Type** | Commit / PR / Test / Review / Merge / Deploy |
| **Source** | Branch or pipeline name |
| **Test Status** | Passed / Warning / Failed / Need Human Review |
| **Executed By** | Agent / Human / Hybrid |
| **Human Approval** | Name of approver or PR comment |
| **Notes** | Short text when relevant (e.g., “Fixed due to security finding”) |

---

## 3. Example of an Automatic Record

```markdown
## 2025-11-11 14:32
ID: IMP-2025-0045  
Action: Commit  
Source: feature/logging_cleanup  
Status: Passed  
Executed by: Agent  
Human Review: Approved by Tomer Kedem (PR-#142)  
Notes: Removed redundant logging from service layer

---

## 4. Data Sources

| Source | Collected Data |
| --- | --- |
| Git Commit | Commit ID, diff summary, author, timestamp |
| Pull Request | Reviewer comments, check status, test results |
| CI Pipeline | Build/Test/Security scan status |
| Agent Runtime | Automated actions, self-check findings, exceptions |

> The agent consolidates this data into a single unified record without modifying previous entries.

## 5. Exceptions and Corrective Actions

When the agent detects a failure, policy violation, or a required fix,  
an automatic **Exception Record** is generated:

```markdown
## Exception
Time: 2025-11-11 15:04  
Event: security_scan_failed  
Auto-pause: yes  
Assigned to: Human Approver  
Resolution: updated dependency version  
Result: Passed after retry
