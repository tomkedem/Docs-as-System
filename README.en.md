## Overview

**Docs-as-System** redefines the role of documentation in the development process.  
It introduces an approach where **documentation, code, and control** all operate together as one unit  
readable to humans, accessible to the agent, and always up to date.

At the center of the methodology stands the **IDE-integrated agent**,  
a smart development partner that reads documents, interprets intent, performs actions,  
and synchronizes in real time between written understanding and the actual implementation.

The methodology serves as a practical framework for developing, documenting, and maintaining systems  
that integrate AI agents inside the development environment.

## How to Start a New Project

To apply Docs-as-System in a real project—and not just as a theoretical idea—there are two practical components:

• An npm starter package  
• An official VS Code extension

### npm Package: Create a New Project with One Command

The official package:

    npx docs-as-system-starterkit init my-project


# Creating a New Project with **Docs-as-System StarterKit**

The command generates a complete project skeleton that includes:

• A **docs** folder with ready-to-use methodology templates  
• A **src** folder with starter code  
• Essential **project configuration** files  
• Initial files required for **structured work with the agent**

More details about the package:  
https://www.npmjs.com/package/docs-as-system-starterkit

## VS Code Extension  
Work Directly Inside the IDE

An official VS Code extension connects to the StarterKit  
and allows you to create and operate Docs-as-System projects directly from the editor.

Extension link:  
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Tomerkedem.docs-as-system

Combining the StarterKit with the extension creates a complete workflow:

1. Create a new project using the **CLI**  
2. Open the project in **VS Code**  
3. Developer and agent collaborate using the documents inside the **docs** folder  

---

## Methodology Templates

All official Docs-as-System templates are located in:  
`/methodology-templates`

The folder is divided into two languages:

• Hebrew templates: `/methodology-templates/he`  
• English templates: `/methodology-templates/en`

All files are written in **Markdown** and ready for direct integration into the IDE or any project.

In a new project created using the StarterKit, the official templates are copied into the **docs** folder,  
where they act as the shared language between human and agent.

---

## Core Principle

Docs-as-System is built on one simple and essential idea:

**Understanding comes before action.**  
Every decision, every agent, and every commit must trace back to a **documented intent**.

The methodology creates a new collaborative language between human and agent.  
Documentation is not an afterthought—it is a **live interface** that shapes development in real time.

## The Agent's Role in the Development Environment

In Docs-as-System projects, the agent is integrated directly into the IDE.  
It does more than help write code—it maintains **continuous alignment** between intent and execution.

The developer writes the *what* in a living document, and the agent implements the *how* in code.  
Every commit becomes an accurate reflection of **documented understanding**.

In a project created using the StarterKit, folders and documents are organized so the agent can read them,  
understand its **boundaries**, and operate according to the defined policy.

## Author’s Note

This project was written and edited by Tomer Kedem with the assistance of an AI agent working directly inside the IDE,  
following the principles of **Docs-as-System**, where human and agent collaborate through a living and evolving documentation layer.
