## 🧭 Overview

**Docs-as-System™** is a modern software development methodology that redefines documentation  
as an active, synchronized part of the development process.  
It introduces a structured approach where **documentation, code, and governance**  
operate as one living system — human-readable, agent-accessible, and always up to date.

At the heart of this methodology lies the **IDE-integrated AI Agent** —  
a development companion that reads documents, interprets intent, executes actions,  
and updates both code and documentation in real time.  
This agent transforms written understanding into executable reality,  
bridging the gap between human reasoning and system behavior.

The concept was created by **Tomer Kedem (2025)**  
as a practical framework for developing, documenting, and maintaining  
AI-assisted systems in the age of intelligent agents.

## 🧩 Philosophy

Docs-as-System™ establishes a simple but powerful principle:

> **Understanding comes before execution.**  
> Every decision, every agent, every commit —  
> must trace back to a documented intent.

This methodology defines a new language of collaboration between **humans and agents**,  
where documentation is not an afterthought but a living interface of meaning, change, and control.  
Each modification in the system updates its documentation,  
and each update in documentation reshapes the system — instantly and transparently.

## ⚙️ The Role of the IDE Agent

In Docs-as-System™ projects, the AI Agent lives inside the developer’s IDE.  
It doesn’t just assist with code — it orchestrates synchronization between  
**intent (docs)** and **execution (code)**.  

The developer defines the "what" through living documentation,  
and the agent carries out the "how" directly in the environment.  
Every commit becomes a verified reflection of documented understanding.
