# A Living Development Methodology with an AI Agent Integrated into the IDE

> Docs-as-System is a living development methodology where documentation, code, and an AI agent operating within the IDE work together as one unified, living, documented, and synchronized system.  
>
> **Documentation is not a byproduct – it is part of the system itself.**  
> _A methodology by [Tomer Kedem](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomer-kedem)_

## 🧭 Overview

**Docs-as-System** redefines the role of documentation in the development process.  
It presents an approach where **documentation, code, and governance** operate together as a single living entity — human-readable, agent-accessible, and always up to date.

At the heart of the methodology lies the **AI agent integrated into the IDE** — an intelligent development partner that reads documents, interprets intent, performs actions, and synchronizes in real time between written understanding and actual implementation.

The methodology serves as a practical framework for developing, documenting, and maintaining systems that incorporate AI agents directly within the development environment.

## 🧱 Methodology Templates

All official Docs-as-System templates  
are located in the [`/methodology-templates`](./methodology-templates) directory.

The directory is divided into two languages:

- English templates — [`/methodology-templates/en`](./methodology-templates/en)  
- Hebrew templates — [`/methodology-templates/he`](./methodology-templates/he)

> All templates are written in Markdown format and can be directly integrated into any IDE or existing development project.

## 🧩 Core Principle

Docs-as-System is based on one simple yet fundamental idea:

> **Understanding comes before execution.**  
> Every decision, every agent, and every commit must trace back to documented intent.

The methodology establishes a new language of collaboration between **humans and agents** — a language where documentation is not an afterthought but a living, meaningful interface.  
Every update to the system changes the documentation, and every update to the documentation affects the system — in real time and with full transparency.

## ⚙️ The Agent’s Role in the Development Environment

In projects built with Docs-as-System, the agent is fully integrated into the IDE.  
It is not merely a coding assistant but a mechanism that ensures continuous synchronization  
between **intent (the documentation)** and **execution (the code)**.

The developer defines the “what” through living documentation, and the agent performs the “how” directly within the environment.  
Each commit becomes an accurate reflection of documented understanding.
