## 🧭 Overview

**™Docs-as-System** redefines documentation as an active, synchronized component of the development process itself.  
It introduces a structured approach where **documentation, code, and governance** operate together  
as a single living entity — readable by humans, interpretable by agents, and always up to date.

At the core of the methodology lies the **AI agent embedded in the IDE** —  
a smart development partner that reads documents, interprets intent, executes actions,  
and continuously synchronizes the written understanding with the actual implementation in real time.

The concept was developed by **Tomer Kedem (2025)**  
as a practical framework for developing, documenting, and maintaining AI-driven systems  
in an era of intelligent agents.

## 🧩 Philosophy

™Docs-as-System is built on one simple but powerful idea:

> **Understanding comes before execution.**  
> Every decision, every agent, every commit — must trace back to documented intent.

The methodology establishes a new language of collaboration between **humans and agents**,  
where documentation is not an afterthought, but a living interface for meaning, change, and control.  
Every system update instantly updates the documentation,  
and every documentation update changes the system — continuously and transparently.

## ⚙️ The Agent in the Development Environment

In projects built with ™Docs-as-System, the agent is deeply integrated into the IDE.  
It is not just a coding assistant — it maintains real-time alignment  
between **intent (the documentation)** and **execution (the code)**.

The developer defines the “what” through living documentation,  
and the agent performs the “how” directly in the environment.  
Each commit becomes a verifiable reflection of documented understanding.
